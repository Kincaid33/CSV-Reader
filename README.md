# CSV Reader built using Python

Python program that reads an existing CSV file called input.csv. The csv
file contains columns of data with particular column name. For each column
(or attribute) in the CSV file, your program would detect the data type and do
 the following:
 
         1. For all columns, find out their mode(s).
         2. For numerical columns (float and integer types), provide
            five-number-summary,
         3. For string, provide unique values of the column values
